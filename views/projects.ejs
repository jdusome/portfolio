            Here are two projects I created during my first year at Georgian College. The first picture is a screenshot of an interactive
            weather monitoring website I created in my Web Authoring class called “The Georgian Weather Hub.” The proceeding YouTube video
            was created for an Arduino Project I made during my Computer Organization and Architecture class!
